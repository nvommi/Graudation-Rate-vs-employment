# Graduation Rate Vs. Employment

The problem I sought to investigate was regarding the high unemployment rate in Baltimore. The national unemployment rate is at about 4.7% while Baltimore is much higher at 7%.

From this resulted the business question, How does the graduation rates of college and high school impact employment rate respectively? I utilized opportunity atlas to gain access to each of these data sets.

After using simple linear regression for both college and high school graduation rates vs. employment, both had a r^2 value closed to 1 indicating a positive correlation. The r^2 value for college graduation rate was 0.81 while High school was 0.98 which could possibly indicate a stronger correlation for high school graduation and employment. However, there was one outlier in the data set for college graduation rates which can be possibly attributed to the lower r^2 value. Looking strictly at the values resulted, it seems as though high school graduation rate has a much stronger impact on employment rate than college graduation rate.

While viewing the multiple linear regression results, the values reflected some similarities to the simple regression. With an R quare value of 0.99, there was an strong positive correlation and the data fit closely with the trendline. However, the nuance to observe is that there were only 5 observation points as there was a lack of data provided online. This limits the ability to generalize the claim to a larger data set since there are not enough trials or data points to make a firm conclusion. Looking at the significance of the values, the High-school graduation rate had a P value of 0.054 while college graduation rate had a p value of 0.94. Both are not statistically significant since the values are not below 0.05, yet high school graduation rate has much stronger signficance than college graduation rate. Once again, the values could have been skewed due to the outlier in the college data set.

Model: Employment rate% = 0.25+(0.597*high school graduation rate)-(0.005*college graduation rate) 

A one unit difference in high school graduation rate is associated with a 0.005 unit difference in employment rate. However, we don't have evidence to suggest that this association exists in the population (the p value is 0.054). This also applies to the college graduation rate (p value of 0.94). 


In summary, based on the numerical findings it seems that high high school graduation rates have a strong positive correlation with high employment rates. This is much more significant and strongly correlated than college graduation rate even though it also has a positive graduation rate. This cannot be used for any concrete claims due to the lack of observations and statistical significance, but this can be used my state government to gain a general idea of how much each level of education impacts employment rate. The information can be used for general visualizations and trends.

Further useful data would have great use regarding this study. More counties, cities, and data points should be surveyed in order to create a more in depth visualization and defensible claim. Additionally, a closer look into Baltimore City, MD to understand why there was an outlier in college graduation would be useful in the study. Neighboring cities with similar demographics and population size could be used to create a useful comparison in order to narrow down reasoning behind why a certain city has a stronger correlation between variables.

According to a previous U.S. census and American Community survey, the unemployment rate has been rising in strong correlation with crime rates. As people are unable to find high-paying jobs, they turn to crime to survive. In today's information based economy, those who are not educated properly cannot earn enough to survive so they drop out of jobs in order to survive via crime.

Currently, Baltimore spends $17,493 per pupil while more than a half billion dollars on its police department. Perhaps allocating more funds to the enrichment of student can prevent crime from occurring and the need for so much to be spent on it. This has seen some positive success seen in New York City and Los Angeles as LA specifically saw major morale boosts. The community was brought together and communities of color, job opportunities, and health all saw positive benefits. Although this can create conflicts with those upper class members who would want more police initiative, working with local and state governments to achieve a reasonable compromise should be feasible as the governments represent the people as a whole, not just one demographic. Following the models of other cities, this could be feasbile.
